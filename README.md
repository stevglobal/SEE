# Fun Calculator

The **Fun Calculator** is a simple Python-based program that performs basic arithmetic operations‚Äîaddition, subtraction, multiplication, and division‚Äîon two numbers provided by the user.

## üìå Description

This interactive command-line tool allows users to input two numeric values (including decimal numbers) and returns the results of the four primary arithmetic operations. It is ideal for beginners learning Python and arithmetic operations through a user-friendly interface.

## üöÄ Features

- Accepts both integers and floating-point numbers.
- Performs:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Displays all results clearly in the console.

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

No external libraries are needed.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named `fun_calculator.py`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved.
4. Run the script using:

   ```bash
   python fun_calculator.py
````

5. Follow the prompts to enter two numbers.

## üß™ Example Usage

```bash
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 15.0
Difference: 5.0
Product: 50.0
Quotient: 2.0
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* **Division by Zero** is not handled in this script. Ensure the second number is not zero to avoid runtime errors.
* All numeric inputs are converted to floats to allow decimal support.
* The program is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.

## üìÇ File Structure

```
fun_calculator.py  # Main Python script
README.md          # Project documentation
```

Feel free to extend this program by adding:

* Input validation
* Error handling (e.g., divide-by-zero)
* Looping to perform multiple calculations
* A graphical user interface (GUI)

Happy Coding!
